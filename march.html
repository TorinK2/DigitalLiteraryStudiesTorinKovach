<p><em>March 17th</em> is a project that mixes computer science and literature, providing a new take on the classic murder mystery. This HTML/CSS/JS story takes readers through the night of March 17th and the murderous Entright family, leading them through a series of riddles to reach the end. The digital format and presentation provide unique advantages, making the story far more interactive and user-centered. Effectively, <em>March 17th</em> transforms the murder mystery from a retrospective, passively read narrative to an actively engaging, conclusion-driven experience â€“ instead of reading about a detective figuring out the crime, the reader figures out the crime themselves.<br>
While I have not currently published the code for this project separately, you can find links to the project here:</p>
